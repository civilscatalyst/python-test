The government has rejected the Opposition's claim that the deal with France to purchase 36 jets was tainted by crony capitalism. The Hindu published this editorial on September 24, three days after former French President Hollande claimed that the Indian government suggested industrialist Anil Ambani\u2019s company as the offset partner for the \u20ac7.87-billion deal.\n\nA regulatory filing at the stock exchanges by Punjab National Bank unveiled a \u20b911,500-crore fraud perpetrated by diamantaire Nirav Modi, allegedly in collusion with bank officials at a South Mumbai branch. This editorial delves deep into the banker-borrower nexus that is often blamed for problems in the banking system.\n\nJanuary 2018 witnessed an unprecedented press conference. Four senior judges of the Supreme Court met the press after submitting a letter to the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. The senior judges claimed the administration of the Supreme Court was not in order and accused Chief Justice Misra of selectively assigning cases and thus hinting that he was misusing his role as the 'master of the roster.' The Hindu published the editorial the next day, terming the press conference \"both momentous and unfortunate\" and called for a collective introspection. It was the only editorial published on that day.\n\nDuring the Monsoon Session of Parliament, the Centre brought a Bill to amend the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as several Dalit groups across the country were angered by its \"dilution\" due to safeguards introduced by the Supreme Court. The apex court had issued a slew of guidelines to protect public servants and private employees from arbitrary arrests under the Atrocities Act. The government introduced the Bill to set the record straight. While welcoming the amendments, this editorial pointed out that the judgment didn't alter or read down any of the key provisions of the Act. However, the procedures laid down by the top court could result in the perception that it was introducing norms to prevent quick action on complaints.\n\nIn a landmark verdict, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court not only approved passive euthanasia but also gave legal status to 'advance directives', popularly known as the living will. While the government was in favour of passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients, it opposed the advance directives. The editorial welcomes the verdict and goes on to say the advance directive only reflects the patient\u2019s autonomy and does not amount to a recognition of a wish to die.\n\nThe government's policy think-tank NITI Aayog released the Health Index report for the first time and Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu took the top ranks. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh were at the bottom of the list. The editorial highlighted the obvious fact that was not mentioned in the NITI Aayog report \u2014 the States with a record of investment in literacy, nutrition and primary healthcare have achieved high scores.\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, the Union government decided to allow 49% foreign stake in Air India, thus setting the stage for its privatisation. Another key decision was to dilute the local sourcing norms for 100% FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading. The Hindu's editorial in January pointed out that the road map for the sale of Air India was ambiguous, and that the decision on FDI in retail should have been taken in 2015 itself. As the year comes to an end, the public carrier is yet to get a suitable offer from any private player. Swedish furniture firm IKEA opened its first Indian store later in the year, taking the 'automatic' route of FDI in retail.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in February, approved a slightly modified version of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal's plan to distribute Cauvery water among the riparian States. The editorial not only welcomed the verdict, but also pointed out that the Centre ought to have done more to end the decades long dispute. \"It will be unfortunate if the States and the Centre are reluctant to accept this verdict and refuse to acknowledge its finality,\" the editorial said.\n\nNearly 32 years after the Assam Accord was signed, the first draft of an updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) for the State was published at midnight on December 31, 2017. It listed 1.90 crore out of the 3.29 crore applicants as citizens. The draft of Assam\u2019s National Register of Citizens is a first step, but it opens up concerns, said the editorial. True to the words, over 40 lakh people were excluded in the final draft leading to a huge uproar. The Centre gave time till the year-end to file objections and has now extended it by another six months.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the last full-fledged Budget of the NDA government. While his earlier budgets focused on fiscal prudence, this one was more about populism. The editorial analysed Mr. Jaitley budget summed it up as thus: \"Overall, the Budget has a sense of direction that is difficult to find fault with.\"", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/specials/oda0yq/article24986738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TH140RAMPICS%202d"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/smile-and-the-whole-world/article25859700.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "These are clips of mishaps/bloopers from movies and TV shows across the world.\n'Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone' is a famous line from Wilcox\u2019s poem Solitude.\nLaughing at someone's minor mishap/blooper is probably normal but smiling at it, I believe, reveals something sinister: smile at someone's mishap/misfortune and evil smiles with you, I\u2019ll say.\nFor instance, people seldom laugh when told of someone descending into penury, but some may smile.\nDo we laugh, weep, cuss, remain indifferent or\u2026 smile when someone succeeds?", "ArticleContent": "I\u2019ve been watching Denis Norden\u2019s \u2018Laughter Files\u2019 series on YouTube. These are clips of mishaps/bloopers from movies and TV shows across the world. Schadenfreude \u2014 deriving pleasure from others\u2019 misfortunes \u2014 is quite impossible to avoid watching those clips that include news anchors/interviewees breaking wind on air, actors forgetting their lines, and so on. Denis Norden, who died some months back, did an excellent job as a host, bringing dignity to a show that was centred on showing humans suffering indignities.\n\nAs children we are often advised not to laugh at someone\u2019s misfortunes, or derive any pleasure out of it. But this is another example of advice that\u2019s often \u2018followed in the breach than in observance\u2019 because it is somehow normal to laugh at someone\u2019s mishap or blooper even if it results in something painful such as a hit below the belt. At the same time not laughing at minor mishaps/bloopers is somehow abnormal, and evokes suspicion.\n\nWhy do we laugh at a mishap or blooper even if it is most embarrassing, perhaps even painful? Laughter analysts believe an unexpected and surprising change can be funny. But I wonder: would we laugh at someone who suddenly begins to ascend from amidst us as we might if the same person tumbles and falls? Would we laugh if a person suddenly collapses for no apparent reason? But we might laugh if a person trips. The reaction of the victim seems vital in evoking or repelling onlookers\u2019 laughter: should the victim take the mishap/blooper in their stride then all ends well. But if the victim shows anger or irritation or insult or pain, then the innocuous laughter can turn into something offensive or even induce a shocking silence. Therefore a mishap or blooper can become an opportunity for the otherwise unpopular/underdog to gain friends. The reaction to an unexpected event generally reveals a side we otherwise conceal or ignore.\n\n'Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone' is a famous line from Wilcox\u2019s poem Solitude. But who does one have for company\n\nwhen one smiles? Laughing at someone's minor mishap/blooper is probably normal but smiling at it, I believe, reveals something sinister: smile at someone's mishap/misfortune and evil smiles with you, I\u2019ll say. For instance, people seldom laugh when told of someone descending into penury, but some may smile. And what about success? Do we laugh, weep, cuss, remain indifferent or\u2026 smile when someone succeeds?\n\nThere are degrees of open schadenfreude. There are situations when people don\u2019t laugh witnessing a mishap. Instead they rush to help, as in a traffic accident. But a pratfall/facefall is always risible as is absent-mindedly walking into a pole, being suddenly scared by an insect, etc. Laughter at someone\u2019s expense is shorter, it seems, the quicker the victim is restored and the laughter may cease altogether replaced with suspense if the victim isn\u2019t quickly restored. Open schadenfreude is muffled if the victim is a known egoistic, or a VVIP. But any schadenfreude from family, particularly from older people, must be accompanied with enough sensitivity; schadenfreude becomes easier to tolerate the lesser the familiarity, and less tolerable when there\u2019s a significant age difference. I\u2019ve noticed how some family elders simply cannot tolerate their family laughing at their bloopers/mishaps. This, alas, increases the generation gap. A blooper/mishap, I\u2019ve noticed, is a golden opportunity to strengthen bonds, particularly between couples whose relationship is somewhat strained if the victim reacts correctly. Schadenfreude is also harder to bear if the onlookers are of opposite sex, and very much pre-menopausal.\n\nLaughter can delay the onset of or even prevent Alzheimer\u2019s, we\u2019re told. But interestingly, neuroscientists have observed that a subtle shift in the things one laugh\u2019s at may foretell Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nI\u2019ve been in a schadenfreude-perfect situation but without evoking any laughter. Once, during my first job in 1992, I stood up from behind my desk to welcome the Principal \u2014 a woman \u2014 and two of my female colleagues who were with her. But they all instantly bolted, leaving me stunned. I realised a little later that I had unbuckled and unzipped a rather tight trouser and quite forgotten about it. It\u2019s a mystery how I retained the job for almost a year afterwards.

Is it simply a term for the expression of a perception of low self-esteem wherein a poor tortured soul as a defence mechanism pretends to laugh at his or her perceived shortcomings before others can? Or is it an elevated state of consciousness where the deprecator is a meta-being who does not give a twig about others\u2019 opinions.\n\nIt could be either, or perhaps a mix of both. A lot hinges on how much time one has to dwell upon this mostly unnecessary contemplation. But then one may argue that half of the subjects under the umbrella of humanities would not exist if it weren\u2019t for \u2018thinkers\u2019 who did not have anything else to do but meditate upon the redundancies of life. So if one decides to dive in to the depths of the concealed complexities of the concept of self-deprecation ; one might discover that it would be perhaps hasty to define this term as merely existing on a two dimensional scale vacillating between low self-esteem and high state of consciousness.\n\nIf career self-deprecators are to be believed then this is a skill primarily used to put the other person (let\u2019s call the other person \u2018the receiver) at ease. In other words, it is done for a good cause. Receiver says forlornly, \u201cOh I love what you are wearing. I can\u2019t believe I showed up for a state dinner with the President in my sweat pants and college T-shirt\u201d. The self-deprecator\u2019s most likely response, \u201cPffttt\u2026these old Armani pantsuits. I got them from Janpath for a steal. And to be honest, who really dresses up for dinner with the President. He is a ceremonial head anyway. Also, let\u2019s not dismiss those sweat pants and college T-shirt right away. It is fun, breezy and you are not trying too hard like the rest of us here. Now I wish I had worn my sweat pants\u201d.\n\nHere if one notices, a multi-pronged approach was employed. The objective is to make the receiver feel less bad for clearly dressing inappropriately for what is a momentous occasion for most people. So the first strategy is to elevate the receiver\u2019s status by appreciating his or hers clearly bad dressing choice. Second strategy is to demote the status of the deprecator himself/herself who is clearly killing it in the Armani pantsuit. Third is to try and diminish the import of the entire environment. And fourth is to mendaciously express that the deprecator himself/herself wishes to have made the same bad choice as the receiver. It is also important to underline here that these approaches very cleverly use two key principles \u2013 Principle of \u2018All things are relative especially self-esteem\u2019 and Principle of \u2018Exaggeration and downright lying\u2019. Now some Miss and Mister Goody Two Shoes may disapprove of the lying aspect. Such morally pompous ladies and gents may be refuted by this pithy quote from Anatole France, \u201cwithout lies humanity would perish of despair and boredom\u201d. And if Yuval Noah Harari, the writer of Sapiens, is to be believed, then every structure that surrounds us family, politics, religion, state; are all imagined orders Basically it\u2019s all a lie. So there is no moral high ground for anyone to ascend upon and sneer at the rest.\n\nNow coming back to the primary subject of Self-deprecation. This science is not without its pitfalls. The biggest risk that self-deprecation faces is that of an ungrateful receiver. True self-deprecators go to unimagined lengths to make receivers feel better. They exaggerate and make up problems that they never had. It needs to be clarified that Self-deprecator here is not a masochistic being who revels in extolling his insecurities. All of this is done with one pure objective \u2013 to somewhat alleviate the misery of the receiver even if momentarily at one\u2019s own expense.\n\nAt the same time, all of this is done with an implied assumption that the receiver throughout this exercise understands the empathetic intent of the self-deprecator. An ungrateful receiver is the kryptonite of a self-deprecator. An ungrateful receiver is the one who doesn\u2019t recognise the intent and actually starts believing the self-humbling narrative being fed to him or her. For instance, in the scenario given above, imagine if the receiver actually starts believing that it is in fact better to wear sweat pants to a state dinner and starts scoffing at the self-\n\ndeprecator for actually making an effort to look awesome. This kind of rebuff has been known to make even the most hardened self-deprecators question their noble path.\n\nTo sum up, there are lessons for both the receivers and the self-deprecators. If you identify yourself as a deprecator then don\u2019t waste your skill on thankless beings. Learn to identify them from afar and just steer clear of them. And if you are a receiver and have spied a self-deprecator around you, cherish them. They are the Mahatma Gandhis of self-esteem. They care about you to such an extent that they are willing to sacrifice their own worth just to make you feel better. One of the best ways to spot this miracle is that even though they may be wearing Armani they will spend their entire evening at a state dinner appreciating how good you look in your stained sweat pants.\n\nshivangir@nrmc.co", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/stories-apart-stories-linked/article25860431.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "Reading in a non-linear wayPerhaps one way to do so would be to read them in a non-linear way.\nThe reader soon enough sees through Abhijit\u2019s over-earnest manner, though we never know if his father ever will.\nEach story stands apart, whole in itself, but each is nourished by the stories that precede and follow it.\nIn Lahiri\u2019s footstepsOnly the last two of the 11 short stories in Indian-American writer Neel Patel\u2019s debut collection, If You See Me, Don\u2019t Say Hi, are linked.\nEach can be read without the other, but read together they transform into more than the sum of the individual narratives.", "ArticleContent": "In The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story, English novelist Philip Hensher nudged the reader to consider \u201cwhat the short story still does well\u201d. As 2018 closes, with its uncommon treasure of big, fat novels (Haruki Murakami\u2019s Killing Commendatore, Javier Marias\u2019s Berta Isla, Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s Unsheltered, to name just a few), two slim publications invite us to modify that appraisal somewhat, to think about what it is that inter-linked short stories do so well.\n\nReading in a non-linear way\n\nPerhaps one way to do so would be to read them in a non-linear way. David Szalay, a Canada-born British writer whose All That Man Is was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2016, would likely have expected the reader to read his new book, Turbulence, from beginning to end. For no good reason, I opened to read the eighth story of his 12 stories. Weighing in at just about 140 pages, Turbulence sets out its structure clearly in the table of contents: as 12 air journeys, the first one \u201cLGW-MAD\u201d (London\u2019s Gatwick airport to Madrid), and the last \u201cBUD-LGW\u201d (Budapest to Gatwick).\n\nThere was enough suggestion that the stories would loop back, that there were connections to be uncovered, but jumping right in at \u201cSGN-BKK-DEL\u201d (Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok to Delhi), I was immersed right away, from story 8\u2019s first sentence: \u201cThe first thing Abhijit did, when he arrived back in Delhi on Monday afternoon, was look in on his father.\u201d His taxi takes Abhijit to the family house in Daryaganj, and while he explains to his father what it was that he was doing in Vietnam (playing golf with his brother Abir, who appears to be somewhat estranged from the father for a reason that we don\u2019t ever get a measure of), it\u2019s almost as if Szalay has coasted into a Ruth Prawer Jhabvala setting, with its depiction of relationships clipped into place with aloofness and manipulation. The reader soon enough sees through Abhijit\u2019s over-earnest manner, though we never know if his father ever will. But Abhijit is found out by the father\u2019s caregiver, who catches the next flight (of story 9, \u201cDEL-COK\u201d, to Kochi).\n\nAnd on it goes, through Doha and Budapest, back to London. Flipping back to the first story, the reader is eventually retuned to Delhi, via Madrid, Dakar, Sao Paulo, Toronto, Seattle, Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City. One character from the preceding story takes the next one forward, in a narrative of human connections, expected (among kin, for example) and unexpected (chance meetings). Some relationships are brittle (Abhijit\u2019s, for instance), some are ephemeral but nourishing, others are long-lasting and poignant. The cast of characters doesn\u2019t just take in various continents, it also captures the diversity of migrations and movements today (the well-regarded novelist, the student abroad, the Syrian refugee, the frazzled journalist, the Indian doctor made good overseas, the Indian worker in West Asia living precariously at the mercy of the goodwill of his \u201csponsor\u201d, etc.).\n\nEach story stands apart, whole in itself, but each is nourished by the stories that precede and follow it. \u201cPeople were able to live multiple lives,\u201d one of the characters says near the end. And each one does, often showing an emotional self different than what she or he did in the previous tale or will do in the next. And each one is affected in some way by what happened elsewhere between people he or she may not know. As the reader returns to the city where the book for her began, there is the sense of having come back to square one with a changed perspective. Turbulence is that brilliant, rare work of fiction that offers itself to multiple readings, not least because the reader can experiment with different narrative loops.\n\nIn Lahiri\u2019s footsteps\n\nOnly the last two of the 11 short stories in Indian-American writer Neel Patel\u2019s debut collection, If You See Me, Don\u2019t Say Hi, are linked. At just over 200 pages, it is a more crowded, noisy and uneven volume, but it nevertheless announces the arrival of a student of human nature to watch out for. Patel\u2019s landscape of the Indian immigrant in the U.S. is similar to Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s earlier work, and it\u2019s telling that the collection opens with a quote from her novel, The Namesake. The hyphenated identity does not always define Patel\u2019s characters, as each one tries to fit in emotionally, to find love on his or her own terms, often with high anxiety and, as the title so evocatively conveys, with the fear of being found out.\n\nThe last two stories, about schoolmates who reconnect as adults at multiple points while navigating through the Indian community\u2019s whispers and conjectures about each other, are also the standout stories in the collection. In their combined sense of loss and reclamation, they also bring to mind the last three stories in Lahiri\u2019s collection, Unaccustomed Earth. Each can be read without the other, but read together they transform into more than the sum of the individual narratives.", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/ka3u15/article25860429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30thbook-2"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/policy-paralysis-anyone/article25860436.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "Market estimates put the amount raised from venture capitalists by Indian start-ups this year at a staggering \u20b944,900 crore.\nThese measures are likely to kill investor interest in Indian start-ups and effectively choke the e-commerce industry, which is largely a two-horse race between Amazon and Flipkart.\nBut the government argues that venture funding at inflated values is actually disguised money laundering, so tax must be paid.\nThe BJP won in 2014 largely because it sold the idea that \u2018policy paralysis\u2019 of the UPA government hurt the economy and the people.\nFour and a half years down the road, its actions are beginning to make policy paralysis look good.", "ArticleContent": "In a generally tough year for business, with the economy still reeling from demonetisation and the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as well as the seemingly unending crisis in the banking sector, arguably the two bright spots were e-commerce and India\u2019s booming start-up space, particularly technology-based start-ups.\n\nTwo bright spots\n\nGlobal retailer Walmart shelled out a whopping $16 billion to acquire a controlling stake in online e-commerce platform Flipkart, to take on rival Amazon. The Jeff Bezos-led e-tailing behemoth, Amazon, has already invested over $15 billion in its Indian venture and has signalled that it will go toe-to-toe with Walmart-Flipkart for as long as it takes. And these investments are going not just into funding discounts for shoppers, which isn\u2019t a bad thing in itself, but in creating warehousing and logistics infrastructure and tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nStart-ups also had a great year. Market estimates put the amount raised from venture capitalists by Indian start-ups this year at a staggering \u20b944,900 crore. That\u2019s not all. Encouraged by new, easier listing norms for start-ups, nearly 25 start-ups took the next step and listed in stock exchanges, raising a further \u20b934,117 crore from the equity markets in 2018.\n\nThe number of venture capital (VC) firms with investments in India has risen to 270 in 2018 compared to a little over 150 five years ago. VC funding has touched $4 billion this year from $3 billion in 2016. As many as eight Indian start-ups (Byju\u2019s, Zomato, Swiggy, Oyo, Paytm Mall, Freshworks, Policybazaar and Udaan) achieved the coveted unicorn status in 2018, signifying a valuation of over $1 billion. According to Inc42 Datalabs, over 3,000 start-ups were launched in 2018.\n\nBut what did the government do? Instead of leaving things as they are, it unleashed a series of measures, ostensibly to promote \u2018India First\u2019 (whatever that is). These measures are likely to kill investor interest in Indian start-ups and effectively choke the e-commerce industry, which is largely a two-horse race between Amazon and Flipkart.\n\nStart-ups first. Earlier this year, start-ups started receiving tax notices under Section 56 (2) (vii, b) of the Income Tax Act, which quickly became known as the \u2018angel tax\u2019. Simply put, tax authorities argued that any company that raises capital that is above its fair-market value is actually earning income from that investment. They demanded tax at the maximum marginal rate on the difference between the fair market value (as determined by the taxman and not the investors who actually put in the money) and the price at which the shares were issued.\n\nTreating capital as income is unique to India and stands all accepted principles of taxation on their head. But the government argues that venture funding at inflated values is actually disguised money laundering, so tax must be paid. Even if this were true in some cases, to treat all legitimate venture funding as money laundering and to attempt to tax it is to kill the proverbial golden goose. The government has said it will review the angel tax, but it said the same thing about the infamous retrospective amendment in the Vodafone case. That amendment is still in the statute books, as is Section 56(2).\n\nNow, e-commerce. Last week, in a press note titled \u2018Review of foreign direct investment in e-commerce\u2019, the government imposed a fresh set of curbs on e-commerce players. Any entity where an e-commerce firm has an equity stake is now barred from selling on that platform. Any e-commerce entity vendor\u2019s inventory will be deemed to be controlled by the e-commerce player if more than 25% of its purchases are from the latter or related firms. In that case, the e-commerce firm becomes inventory-based, where FDI isn\u2019t allowed.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all. The government also introduced a sunset clause on differential pricing (read: deep discounts) and went so far as to disallow special \u2018exclusive\u2019 marketing deals with manufacturers for products launched exclusively on an e-commerce platform.\n\nNot the government\u2019s job\n\nAll this takes micromanagement to a ridiculous degree. From deciding the fair value of a start-up to deciding how much discount can be offered to consumers, to deciding how, where and at what price a producer is to sell his goods is certainly not the government\u2019s job. While all this is being done to ostensibly promote \u201cswadeshi\u201d enterprise and \u201cprotect\u201d the consumer, it will actually achieve the opposite.\n\nThe small retailer/trader, for whose benefit these measures have been taken, has been hurt more by demonetisation and GST than by e-commerce. India\u2019s retail market is expected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2020, of which e-retail will account for around $100 billion, or less than 10%.\n\nThe BJP won in 2014 largely because it sold the idea that \u2018policy paralysis\u2019 of the UPA government hurt the economy and the people.

The gate is at the other end, and for a moment I am jealous of the old woman in her cozy wheelchair. Heading to the designated gate is always the closest I\u2019ll be to home without being there. The seats are filled with people of my facial features. The air is filled with Malayalam and not unknown tongues. There\u2019s even a mild whiff of alcohol. This gate instantly makes me feel less of an outsider in this strange city.\n\nMutual state identity however, does not make us any less silly and we all jump and rush when the gate opens. Of my few strengths, I count jostling with senior citizens in the queue to board as one and I am not last in this race. On the aircraft, the face theatrics begin. As I have the window seat, I tell the long -legged chap with the aisle seat that I have to squeeze through. Both of us being stoic males, we communicate through curled lips and eyebrow movements.\n\nThe poor cabin crew\u2019s instructions, to be followed in case of an emergency, fall on deaf ears. Silly lady doesn\u2019t know we\u2019ve accepted our fate. Barely before we begin flying in a straight line, we are hit with bargain deals of a samosa at Rs. 200. Eyes are diverted to those who are rich enough to pay. Four glasses of water convince my wallet to remain in my pocket. Well-fed, I perform beginner\u2019s yoga in attempting to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I try to sleep on my arm (if I were more adventurous maybe my co-passenger\u2019s). Four seconds later the bright lights are switched on and we\u2019re thanked profusely for flying with the airline and the team. The voice rapidly mumbles other parting requests.\n\nTouch-down follows and the adrenaline rush to leave the plane hits everyone \u2013 both young and old alike. The incapacitated woman in the front who required a wheelchair quickly sits down. We rush into the buses like school kids. We stubbornly refuse to go to the back of the bus and squeeze in the front. Phone notifications pour in and assurances of reaching home echo. Picking up my luggage I know I\u2019ll be filled with bitterness the next time I\u2019m here, leaving for that strange land again.\n\nvarunrao055@gmail.com", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/last-years-lies-next-years-lies/article25860424.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "This list can include anything from bad films and songs, fashion bloopers, exposed public lies, dustbinned politicians and outed criminals to the terrible strokes played by Indian batsmen that they cannot, possibly, repeat again.\nLies come in all sorts of fancy packaging.\nActually our social fabric has taken severe damage since 2014.\nIt\u2019s true that more and more people are speaking freely and diverse voices are being heard.\nThat\u2019s because thousands of citizens have had the courage to come out on the streets and challenge this small-eyed, know-nothing, backward-hurtling government.", "ArticleContent": "One good way to end any year is to look back at all the things you hated and make a list of the stuff that you reckon won\u2019t ever be coming back. This list can include anything from bad films and songs, fashion bloopers, exposed public lies, dustbinned politicians and outed criminals to the terrible strokes played by Indian batsmen that they cannot, possibly, repeat again.\n\nThe problem is in getting this list right. Bad films and songs have a way of rising out of the grave, fangs of mediocrity bared, sucking the blood from your cinesphere and sonosphere for the next so many decades; fashion bloopers like to reappear as \u2018witty\u2019 sartorial quotations; and the terrible strokes played by Indian batsmen are a bit like the Delhi police\u2019s slogan in the 2000s: With you, for you, always. As for politicians going into the dustbin, the longer you live, the more clearly you learn never, ever, to count on this: a politician isn\u2019t in the trash can till he has left us for the afterlife, and even then, the worst ones have a way of developing this toxic, hovering half-life, like ineptly decommissioned nuclear plants.\n\nPublic lies\n\nAs for the public lies, they have a special choreography as they dance around in a game of musical chairs, one fib sliding into a seat where another has just vacated, one untruth left standing in the cold, but never completely out of the game, never chair-less for long. Lies, especially political ones, also come in the shape of actions: you vote for a programme of development and anti-corruption, but you may get a chief minister for whom you did not vote, a man with the narrowly vicious world view of a provincial bigot; you vote for a change from bigotry and nepotism, but you may get a chief minister who people say they have seen leading murderous mobs, albeit three decades ago.\n\nLies come in all sorts of fancy packaging. You can unpack the lie, throw it in the dustbin along with its wrapping at the end of a given year, and think you are done. Wrong. The same lie will be marketed to you in different livery, with freebies stickered on the packaging \u2014 buy this one big lie, get another mini-lie totally free.\n\nHere\u2019s one such lie that has had many mutations and multiple attempts at penetrating the \u2018market\u2019: Version No.1/2014: When Narendra Modi comes to power, conducting business will be easier, corruption will disappear, the economy will grow, and no, there will be no attacks on the minorities.\n\nVersion No.2/2017: The Modi government has taken some \u2018bold and difficult\u2019 decisions; demonetisation is working like a banshee on cocaine, it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t see it yet; conducting business will get easier, just give the government some more time (70 years of uninterrupted Congress rule is hard to dismantle, you see). And these chhut-putt attacks on minorities and Dalits? Oh, they are freak incidents, not sanctioned by the people in charge, of course not!\n\nThe social fabric of India\n\nVersion No.38/2018: Look, as we promised, nothing has damaged the social fabric of India since 2014; you can debate demonetisation but you can\u2019t debate the triumph of GST; there is no corruption in high places, none, no one is favouring the oligarchy, there\u2019s nothing to see here, please move on; the minorities are not cowering in their homes, no, what you hear is exaggerated fake news, so what if it\u2019s from all over the country, and so what if farmers are marching, students are marching, Dalits are marching, it\u2019s all fine, there\u2019s a disciplined hand on the tiller; and there has been no corruption of our major educational institutions by putting incompetent toadies in charge with the specific mission of orange-o-fying and destroying those institutions.\n\nActually our social fabric has taken severe damage since 2014. Our minorities are living in terror in many parts of the country. But it\u2019s true that this December the Constitution is safer from Hindutva sabotage than it was last January. This is because four big States have voted against the BJP. It\u2019s true that the Supreme Court looks strong. That is because the senior-most judges came out and pushed back at the Chief Justice\u2019s methods of administration, because they narrowed the scoring angle for anti-democratic forces. It\u2019s true that more and more people are speaking freely and diverse voices are being heard. That\u2019s because thousands of citizens have had the courage to come out on the streets and challenge this small-eyed, know-nothing, backward-hurtling government.\n\nAs this year ends, many of the tired lies of the last four years seem to have been uprooted, but we\u2019ll have to be vigilant in the coming year about how quickly some of these falsehoods find purchase again.", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/ft58f1/article25860422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30thlies"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/new-words-for-a-dying-world/article25860451.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "Throughout 2018, as more evidence of global warming and other environmental disasters emerged \u2014 forest fires, hurricanes, pollution, dust storms \u2014 I invented words that describe a future where oceans have risen and coastal cities have partially or entirely drowned.\nCartocreep: Previously agreed land-sea boundaries on maps that now need to be redrawn due to rising waters.\nDecoralation: When those who previously denied global warming now change their colours, like bleached corals, and reappear in public debates as always having argued for it.\nLuxurions: Couples who see no point in having children given rising waters, social chaos, and crumbling institutions and therefore decide to enjoy life and head into \u201cluxurious extinction\u201d.\nTurtling: Mimicking turtles, humans travel to faraway countries, especially those little affected by global warming, to give birth to children for the sake of citizenship.", "ArticleContent": "Throughout 2018, as more evidence of global warming and other environmental disasters emerged \u2014 forest fires, hurricanes, pollution, dust storms \u2014 I invented words that describe a future where oceans have risen and coastal cities have partially or entirely drowned.

In real life who actually stands and waits \u2014 other than perhaps those who are waiters by profession? Of course they also serve. But how does that apply universally?\n\nWe do stand and wait in queues but never thereby serve anyone except ourselves. There must be something wrong somewhere. There are explanations/commentaries of all kinds for that line but I, for one, had never really understood it.\n\nAll that changed in just a few hours the other day. It was almost like Buddha getting his enlightenment at Bodh Gaya. Only, in my case it was in my daughter Meera\u2019s house in the U.K.\n\nAs she left for work that morning, Meera told me she was expecting a delivery \u2014 against an online order \u2014 sometime between eight and ten. Could I delay my morning ablutions until after taking the delivery, she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat! That early in the morning!\u201d I said. \u201cDeliveries are usually between 10 and 5, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the Christmas season they can be any time during the day and often even at night. I had a text last night from the supplier to expect delivery early this morning. The packet can be heavy; don\u2019t carry it in your hands. You can tell the delivery man to leave it in the hall. And don\u2019t try to move it.\u201d\n\nI looked at the clock. It showed 7-50. I lingered on in the living room. From the nearest bookshelf I picked up His Last Bow by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I had bought that at a second-hand bookshop in the U.K. and devoured it. That was many years ago. A second look might be worthwhile.\n\nI was halfway through its first story when the doorbell rang. It was 8-30. I hobbled to the door, and sure enough there was this delivery man. He said good morning and then rather apologetically, \u201cHere\u2019s one packet for next door, No.28. There is no one there. Sorry to trouble you, but can you please take this and hold it for the addressee? I shall leave a note through their mail slot that the packet is with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d I said. I had done that I don\u2019t know how many times. It was indeed standard practice in these parts. It was a small packet.\n\nAround 9-30 Meera called. When she learned that her packet had not arrived she seemed contrite: \u2018I wasted your morning for nothing!\u2019 she sighed. \u201cOh no, there was a delivery at 08:30,\u201d I said, \u201cbut that was for Dolores next-door. In the normal course I would still be in the bath then, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? The man would have tried another neighbour!\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I spare him that trouble?\u201d I asked. That didn\u2019t impress her. She said something about it being boy-scout-ish to think like that!\n\nAs it happened, there were three more deliveries before 10, all for No. 28. Around 11, Meera called again. She said she had a text message from the supplier that the delivery had been delayed until further notice.\n\nThe wait had ended. I was then on my third story in His Last Bow. As always, Sherlock Holmes and Watson were great company. The wait had served to renew my acquaintance with the book.\n\nDolores\u2019s husband John collected the four packets in the afternoon. \u201cThanks ever so much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Peter\u2019s birthday today. And these are for him. Cheers!\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday to Peter!\u201d I said.

Not just practice, but at least 10,000 hours of dedicated and passionate practice, to be really good. He gives examples as proof, in a book, Outliers.\n\nI have come to believe in his postulation. But I don\u2019t think that is the end of it. Because I saw this in practice at the December Music Festival in Chennai. Artists enthralled audiences with music and earned their praise and accolades by such wonderful performances that it left me wonder, \u201cwhat does it take to perform at that level\u201d. Clearly, all of them have practised for thousands of hours to get to where they are. Putting in the hours is only one part.\n\nI asked one of the leading artistes if 10,000 hours of passionate practice is all it takes. Her answer was an eye-opener. She took the example of the venerable Maha Periyava, Sri Chandrasekara Swamigal of the Kanchi Math. He spent his entire life studying the vedas, reciting them for thousands of hours, and spent the remaining time listening to vedas and puranas from vedic scholars every day, for hours together. He devoted his life to the vedas and upanishads, so much so that he is to have said, my God is in the vedas and my faith is the scriptures.\n\nLikewise, the musician said, my God and Faith is Music and I would like to spend all my life practising and listening to music. Music is my faith, it gives me the most happiness.\n\nI was trying to connect this with Arthur Brooks, a western economist, who has written and spoken a lot about happiness. In a recent talk in Chennai he stated that after a certain age happiness does not come with wealth or the pleasures of life or power and position, but only from Faith, family, friends and work. This has been endorsed by a whole body of intellectuals and ordinary mortals. Dr Brooks has research studies to back it.\n\nI could relate to Dr. Brooks\u2019 theory, except that I had difficulty appreciating Faith. To me faith meant God, the gurus, some symbols and idols, and I have seen in India that form of faith leads to more unhappiness than happiness in society. Dr. Brooks does talk about faith being different from what we normally take it to be. Creativity and spirituality are in his vocabulary a form of faith.\n\nNow I realise a whole new way of understanding faith. Faith as music, faith as vedas, faith in a dance form and faith that gets one to dedicate at least 10,000 hours of passionate practice that one can derive happiness out of being really good at it. I see this happiness and bliss in the veda rakshaks I come across, who passionately teach young children and adults the same vedas that Maha Periyava learnt. I see this happiness and bliss in the exponents of music and art and lecture-demonstrators, who become visible during the December season. May the New Year help us find our faith, as we celebrate the music-dance season, and Maha Periyava.\n\nPerhaps, food can become a faith too! Get the caterers to spend 10,000 or more hours of practice so they dish out good recipes, as we celebrate music, dance and vedic recitals during the season!\n\nThe author is emeritus vice-chairman, Cognizant.

Another spasm of the ghoul\u2019s body and I jumped up, screaming and running out of the room and waking up everybody at home.\n\nThis is just one of the times we cousins had met over a \u2018movie night\u2019! When we get together for one such night, it\u2019s usually a bragging session, where each one is trying to convince the group to watch a movie they like. And no matter whose suggestion we agree to finally, the end result is always the same: the person whose choice it was ends up getting drowned in the cacophony of the rest of us screaming and shouting about having put us through such a torturous three hours!\n\nThis reminds me of that one time when my cousin proudly strutted in with his laptop saying he had \u2018just for us\u2019 downloaded his favourite movie and we would be watching that one that night. It was the \u2018best comedy movie\u2019 he had ever seen and we were told we would die laughing! Well, we sure did die, but not of laughing, but by sheer exasperation on what was unfolding on the screen! Leave alone laugh, it failed to elicit even a hint of a smile on any of our faces. And no matter how much that cousin tried to convince us that the next scene will be funny, we finally managed to make him shut up.\n\nHe remained the butt of jokes through the entire night. And though his movie didn\u2019t make us laugh, we still died laughing pulling his leg at the choice of his movie.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued whining about how we don\u2019t have any \u2018class\u2019 when it comes to movies! I must at this point confess I too have been at the receiving end so many times!\n\nPersonal experience\n\nWhen I\u2019m out of my hometown, movie-watching becomes a very personal experience, in my room, on my laptop! Even in my room, with my roommate, either her or my watching a movie sometimes resulted in very awkward experiences.\n\nWe never watched a movie together, so it always happened that whenever she was watching one and I was suddenly subjected to an asura-type laughter, I would turn my face up from my book and look at her with a \u2018what-the-hell-happened\u2019 countenance.\n\nAnd the same response I would get when I unleashed my demonic laughter on her! I don\u2019t think either of us liked the idea of watching a sob-story when the other was in the room\u2026 who wants to let everyone know they cry while watching movies?\n\nNow here on this campus, movie-watching has taken a different turn altogether, with the \u2018Movie Club\u2019 showing a movie every Friday at 9 in the auditorium. I love watching movies at the campus auditorium because I enjoy the environment the campus brings\u2026 those hoots, cat-calls\u2026 the whistles when the hero or heroine finally achieves what he/she set out for, or the solemn claps at the end as a mark of respect to the maker if it\u2019s a serious movie!\n\nThe experience of watching movie in an auditorium full of youthful millennial campus students is a different experience altogether. Not that I\u2019m very old myself!\n\nThere\u2019s definitely some charm that these cosy, cuddly winters hold, what with the Christmassy glitter and all! They make you want to catch up with your cousins or friends, or just yourself, and curl up inside a warm blanket and watch a movie you always wanted to! And bless Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime, now it has become easier than ever! And it\u2019s always so after the sun is down, and night has spread its beautiful star-studded blanket, that the urge is felt, to spend the night watching a movie, together, with our loved ones!\n\nFor, the charm of being cuddled up inside a blanket on a winter\u2019s night with shapes shifting on the screen in front of you, providing you warmth, bringing a smile on your face, and a glitter in your eyes, is priceless indeed!\n\nunnati_a@ymail.com", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/t2ngrc/article25860534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20181229115013"}}, {"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/growing-up-with-you-the-child/article25860541.ece": {"ArticleSummary": "I put you down on a mat in the hall with all the paraphernalia \u2013 napkins, water, spoons, food and toys.\nSuddenly you start screaming and I see that you have touched the flame.\nClimbing in beside you, I softly kiss your cheeks and you put your arms around me without opening your eyes.\nI walk around the school, all the while hearing your screams, which stop the moment you see me come back in.\nWe both dry our tears and head out, hand in hand, truly relieved that the day\u2019s ordeal is over.", "ArticleContent": "Sometimes we don\u2019t realise what we would have missed all along until we actually get it. I had never considered what it really means to be a mother until I held you, the baby you, outside our home that fine evening, and you put your tiny arms around my shoulders and buried your face deep in the crook of my neck. In a rush of epiphany, I lifted you in front of my face, peered into your face in the twilight and think \u2013 oh so this is how a baby of mine looks like, why I never wondered about that before!\n\nYou have been started on semi-solid food. You are a very fuzzy eater. I put you down on a mat in the hall with all the paraphernalia \u2013 napkins, water, spoons, food and toys. I am talking and singing non-stop trying to coax you to eat. I dash into the kitchen to boil some milk, hoping you wouldn\u2019t notice my absence. But something moves near my feet. It is you \u2013 who have crawled after me double-quick. I concede defeat and set you up, mat and all, on the kitchen floor itself.\n\nIt is getting dark and suddenly the lights go out. The doorbell rings. Cradling you in one hand, I pick up a candle and open the door. Suddenly you start screaming and I see that you have touched the flame. As I rush about to apply some cold water and try to soothe you, my remorse at not foreseeing your innocent fascination for the flame streams down my eyes.\n\nWe are out visiting but I sense bad vibes with the people around. You start crying non-stop, quite out of character. I have to take you out of the house and am able to escape the conversation almost completely.\n\nI am far from you, pursuing higher studies, and rush home every weekend braving sleepless nights in buses. Each time it\u2019s early morning when I reach. You are in bed, pretending to be still asleep. Climbing in beside you, I softly kiss your cheeks and you put your arms around me without opening your eyes. Later, squeezed tight into my lap, you start telling me all your news of the week. The list gets exhausted and we sit in silence. I see that your mind is busy searching and wait patiently. Suddenly you scramble away to get something. Someone reminds you that you had already told me about it last week. Your face falls. An attack of amnesia comes over me and we both settle down for a repeat of the long story.\n\nI am trying to train you for a few hours of nursery school, and am asked to come back in half an hour. I walk around the school, all the while hearing your screams, which stop the moment you see me come back in. We both dry our tears and head out, hand in hand, truly relieved that the day\u2019s ordeal is over.\n\nI am watching you in the playground. I find that I can sense even the slightest variations in your equations with your playmates. A sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu comes over me and I realise I am actually looking at myself, a true reflection cutting across years.\n\nYou have seated me along with your dolls and teddies, each with an open book in front. I have to respond on behalf all the students, in different voices, of course. I watch your serious face, gesticulating as you take the class, and am transported to another world where the lines dividing animals and humans blur, where animals talk about feelings and even talk back rude.\n\nYou are on the stage, part of a children\u2019s drama. I watch from the sidelines, tired after many days of shuttling you to rehearsals, juggling our schedules and getting hold of costumes and accessories. As I see you infusing magic into the role and hear the deafening applause, I understand that no personal achievement of my own can match the surge of happiness in my heart, which feels as if it would burst.\n\nYou have grown so tall that I need to raise my hands to touch your face. There are guests at home. Someone says something that hurts me. As I sit silently, flush from the hot words which I am swallowing, I feel your glance on me from across the room. Later, you come near, playfully box my ears while whispering \u2018hey, why angry?\u2019 and give me a squeeze and I know for sure, my darling, that the umbilical cord that once connected you to me has never really been severed.\n\njaya.gn@gmail.com", "ArticleImage": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/oy8oa8/article25860540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mother-final"}}]}
